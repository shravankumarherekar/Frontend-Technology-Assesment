# Frontend Technology Assessment

## Overview

This project is a responsive website built using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and jQuery/Javascript. It includes a header with a navigation bar, a banner section with a background image and text overlay, content organized in tabs, and a footer. The design ensures responsiveness across different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, and mobile). The content in the tabs is dynamically loaded without reloading the page using jQuery/Javascript.
